## Getting Started

```
$ pnpm install
$ pnpm start
```
## Conventions

### Core
- use single quotes
- use semicolons
- two spaces for indentation
- no comma dangles

### Imports/Exports
- two newlines after imports
- exports always go at the bottom (export default is on the last line)
- group exports whenever possible
- avoid relative imports whenever depth greater than one
